# Postgres Snippets

### Toc:
1. Connect with pg driver for node (in progress, need async export but that will print)
2. Connect with pg-promise (npm: pg-promise) and start express api that serves pg data
3. Feathers Integration with sequelize

## 2. pg-promise express
	Serve postgres pg-promise over express json responses on the url /pull. Only gets 50 records to save time as this is a basic proof. Use the python library http(todo: link) for easy terminal requests.
